>> you can read the thread ive attached it but its kind of long so ive summarized it here: 
>> 
>> ## 3 stages of a bear market; we are in stage 2
>> 
>> ### Stage 1: The Unwind 
>> Excitement and greed from the bull market exists 
>> Assets still have floors 
>> Valuations are cut but companies don't make the tough decisions (kill products, layoffs)
>> Doesn’t like a bear market. 
>> Feels like prices have pulled back to "realistic" valuations
>> Investors continue allocating, builders keep building…
>> Only the weak hands sell.
>> 
>> ### Stage 2: Forced Capitulation
>> Narratives die
>> Layoffs; Prices fall 90%... then another 90%
>> Mainstream media and cynics rise
>> Luna sent us into Stage 2
>> Diamond hands become forced sellers; sell not bc they want to, bc they have to
>> Celsius doesn't want to sell – they might have to sell.
>> Will be more funds, companies, and individuals like Celsius
>> Any bounce will be immediately sold into; The dead cat bounce
>> Companies that needs high token prices will be crushed
>> Founders that buy their own tokens to sustain their projects will get crushed
>> The lower prices go, the louder the bears get. 
>> The louder the bears, the lower the price go 
>> This creates a vicious cycle -> prices crash violently.
>> 
>> ###Stage 3: Bottomless Exhaustion 
>> no bounces; no narratives
>> Prices consolidate sideways or slowly move down
>> It's boring; anger is replaced by silence.
>> You'll want to walk away; Regulators still persistent; Twitter degens go quiet
>> Web2 investors stop allocating; Talented builders leave; companies shut down
>> If you're a company, do whatever it takes to get through.
>> If you're a builder, stay interested. Find other builders. Build with them.
>> If you're an investor, develop your own theses; Take bets on stuff you believe in
>> Don't lose sight of the big picture
>> Many talented people left; those who stayed were rewarded.
